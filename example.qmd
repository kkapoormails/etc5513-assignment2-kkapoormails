## Introduction: 

This Quarto document will demonstrate how to use Git and GitHub for version control and reproducible workflows.

### Step 3:

#### Branches in Git let us work on changes without touching the main version of the project.  This is helpful when we want to test, edit, or build features separately.

#### Step 3.1: Create and Switch to a New Branch

We want to create a branch called \`testbranch\` and start working in it.

This allows us to make changes without affecting the main version of our project.

In the terminal, I ran:

1.  **git switch -c testbranch**

2.  What it does is it creates a branch and at the same time switches to the new branch as well in one go:

3.  We can also do this in two separate steps

    1.   First, create the branch:

        1.  git branch testbranch

    2.  Then, switch to it:

        1.  git switch testbranch

4.  Both approaches work the same — but using git switch -c is quicker.

#### Step 3.2:  Modify example.qmd and Commit the Changes

In this step, we’ll make a small change to the example.qmd file inside the testbranch.

This helps demonstrate how Git tracks changes and lets us commit them in a separate branch.

-   This line was added in the testbranch to demonstrate branching and committing.

Then I ran the following commands in the terminal:

-   git add example.qmd

-   git commit -m "Step 3.2: Added line to example.qmd in testbranch"
